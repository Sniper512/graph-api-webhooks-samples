**Do I need a consultation before treatment?**
First-time clients receiving injectables, laser treatments, or chemical peels require an in-person consultation. This can be done on the same day as your treatment if your schedule permits. Basic facials and maintenance treatments don't require a separate consultation visit.

**Can I book multiple treatments in one visit?**

However, some treatments cannot be performed on the same day due to skin sensitivity. Our booking team will advise you on the best scheduling.

## TREATMENT-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

### BOTOX & INJECTABLES

**How long does Botox last?**
Botox typically lasts 3-4 months. First-time clients may find results last slightly shorter (2.5-3 months), while regular clients often extend results to 4-5 months as muscles become trained. Factors like metabolism, activity level, and treatment area affect duration.

**Does Botox hurt?**
Most clients describe a slight pinching sensation. We use ultra-fine needles and can apply numbing cream upon request. Ice is applied before and after injection to minimize discomfort. The entire procedure takes 10-15 minutes with minimal pain.

**When will I see Botox results?**
Initial results appear within 3-5 days, with full effects visible at 10-14 days. We schedule follow-up appointments at 2 weeks to assess results and perform any necessary touch-ups at no additional charge.

**What's the difference between Botox and fillers?**
Botox relaxes muscles that cause wrinkles (frown lines, crow's feet, forehead lines), while dermal fillers add volume to areas with lost fullness (lips, cheeks, under-eyes, nasolabial folds). They're often used together for comprehensive facial rejuvenation.

**How many units of Botox will I need?**
Average doses vary by area: forehead (10-30 units), crow's feet (5-15 units per side), frown lines (15-25 units). Your practitioner will determine the appropriate amount during consultation based on your muscle strength and desired results.

**Can I exercise after Botox?**
Avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours post-treatment. Light walking is fine, but activities that increase blood flow to the face (running, yoga inversions, heavy lifting) should be postponed to prevent bruising and ensure optimal product placement.

**What are the side effects of injectables?**
Common side effects include temporary redness, swelling, bruising, and minor bumps at injection sites, typically resolving within 24-48 hours. Rare side effects include asymmetry, headache, or allergic reaction. Serious complications are extremely rare when performed by qualified practitioners.

### LASER TREATMENTS

**How does laser hair removal work?**
Laser energy targets melanin in hair follicles, heating and damaging them to inhibit future growth. Multiple sessions are required because hair grows in cycles. After 6-8 treatments, most clients achieve 80-95% permanent hair reduction.

**Is laser hair removal painful?**
Most clients describe it as a rubber band snapping sensation. Pain levels vary by area (underarms and bikini are more sensitive). We use cooling technology and can apply numbing cream for sensitive areas. Most people find it very tolerable.

**How many laser hair removal sessions will I need?**
Most clients need 6-8 sessions spaced 4-8 weeks apart for optimal results. Factors affecting this include hair color, skin tone, hormonal factors, and treatment area. Maintenance sessions (1-2 per year) may be needed.

**Can laser hair removal work on all skin tones?**
Our Nd:YAG laser safely treats all skin tones including dark skin (Fitzpatrick types I-VI). We use customized settings for your specific skin type to ensure safety and effectiveness.

**What should I do before laser hair removal?**
Shave the treatment area 24 hours before your appointment. Avoid sun exposure, tanning, and self-tanners for 2 weeks prior. Don't wax, pluck, or bleach for 4 weeks before treatment as the laser needs the hair root intact.

**What is laser skin resurfacing?**
Laser resurfacing uses focused light to remove damaged skin layers, stimulating collagen production. It treats wrinkles, scars, sun damage, uneven texture, and pigmentation. We offer both ablative (more aggressive) and non-ablative (minimal downtime) options.

**What's the downtime for laser treatments?**
This varies by treatment intensity. Non-ablative lasers have minimal downtime (1-2 days of redness). Ablative resurfacing requires 7-14 days of healing. Laser hair removal has no downtime. We'll discuss expected recovery during your consultation.

### FACIALS & PEELS

**What type of facial is right for me?**
This depends on your skin concerns:
- Acne: deep cleansing or salicylic acid facial
- Anti-aging: collagen-boosting or vitamin C facial
- Hydration: hyaluronic acid or moisture therapy
- Brightening: enzyme or glycolic facial
We'll recommend the best option during consultation.

**How often should I get facials?**
For optimal results, monthly facials are recommended. This aligns with your skin's natural renewal cycle (28-30 days). Maintenance clients may extend to every 6-8 weeks. Problem skin may benefit from treatments every 2-3 weeks initially.

**What's the difference between chemical peels?**
- Superficial peels (no downtime): gentle exfoliation, brightening
- Medium peels (2-5 days downtime): treats pigmentation, fine lines
- Deep peels (7-14 days downtime): dramatic results for severe damage
We'll recommend the appropriate depth based on your concerns and lifestyle.

**Can I wear makeup after a facial or peel?**
After most facials, you can apply makeup immediately, though we recommend waiting 4-6 hours. After chemical peels, wait 24 hours for light peels, 48-72 hours for medium peels. We'll provide specific aftercare instructions.

**Will my skin peel after a chemical peel?**
Not always. Superficial peels may cause no visible peeling, just some flaking. Medium peels typically cause 3-5 days of visible peeling. The depth of peel and your skin type determine the amount of visible shedding.

### MICRONEEDLING

**What is microneedling?**
Microneedling uses tiny needles to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin, triggering collagen and elastin production. It treats acne scars, fine lines, large pores, uneven texture, and stretch marks. Results develop over weeks as new collagen forms.

**Does microneedling hurt?**
We apply numbing cream 20-30 minutes before treatment, making the procedure quite comfortable. Most clients describe a vibrating sensation. Sensitivity varies by area - forehead is less sensitive than around the mouth or nose.

**How many microneedling sessions do I need?**
Most clients need 3-6 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart. Mild concerns may improve with 3 sessions, while acne scarring typically requires 6+ sessions. Maintenance treatments every 6-12 months help sustain results.

**What's the downtime for microneedling?**
Your skin will be red for 12-48 hours (similar to a mild sunburn). Makeup can be applied after 24 hours. Most clients return to normal activities the next day. Avoid sun exposure and intense exercise for 48 hours.

**Can microneedling be combined with other treatments?**
Yes, microneedling is often combined with PRP (platelet-rich plasma), growth factors, or specialized serums for enhanced results. We can also coordinate with Botox and fillers, though timing is important - we'll create an optimal treatment schedule.

### BODY CONTOURING

**How does body contouring work?**
We offer multiple technologies: CoolSculpting (freezing fat cells), RF (radiofrequency tightening), ultrasound cavitation (breaking down fat), and muscle toning (electrical stimulation). Each targets different concerns like fat reduction, skin tightening, or muscle definition.

**Am I a good candidate for body contouring?**
Ideal candidates are near their goal weight with stubborn fat pockets or loose skin that doesn't respond to diet and exercise. Body contouring is not a weight-loss solution but rather a body-shaping tool. BMI under 30 is typically recommended.

**How many body contouring sessions will I need?**
This varies by technology and treatment area. CoolSculpting may require 1-3 sessions per area. RF tightening typically needs 6-8 sessions. Results are gradual, developing over 8-12 weeks. We'll create a customized treatment plan during consultation.

**Is body contouring painful?**
Most treatments are comfortable. CoolSculpting causes cold and pulling sensations initially, then numbness. RF feels like a hot stone massage. Ultrasound cavitation may cause mild warmth or tingling. There's no anesthesia needed and no needles involved.

**When will I see body contouring results?**
Results develop gradually as your body naturally processes treated fat cells and produces collagen. Initial changes appear at 3-4 weeks, with optimal results at 8-12 weeks. Some clients continue improving for up to 6 months post-treatment.

**Are body contouring results permanent?**
Fat cells destroyed through CoolSculpting are permanently eliminated. However, remaining fat cells can expand with weight gain. Maintaining a stable weight through healthy lifestyle preserves results. Skin tightening results last 1-2 years and can be maintained with touch-ups.

## SAFETY & SIDE EFFECTS

**Are your treatments safe?**
Yes, when performed by qualified practitioners using FDA-approved technologies. All our equipment is regularly maintained and calibrated. We follow strict safety protocols, use sterile techniques, and provide thorough pre-treatment assessments to minimize risks.

**What are the most common side effects?**
Most treatments cause temporary redness, swelling, or minor bruising. These typically resolve within 24-48 hours. More intensive treatments may have longer recovery periods. We provide detailed aftercare instructions to minimize side effects and optimize results.

**Can I have treatments if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**
Most aesthetic treatments are not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding as a precautionary measure, though research on many procedures is limited. We recommend waiting until after you've finished breastfeeding. Pregnancy-safe facials and certain skincare treatments are available.

**What if I have an allergic reaction?**
We conduct patch tests for clients with sensitive skin or known allergies. If you experience unusual swelling, rash, or difficulty breathing after treatment, contact us immediately or seek emergency care. We provide 24/7 emergency contact information to all clients.

**Do treatments cause scarring?**
When performed correctly, our treatments should not cause scarring. Some intensive procedures (deep chemical peels, ablative lasers) carry minimal scarring risk, which we discuss during consultation. Following post-treatment instructions is crucial to prevent complications.

**Can treatments cause permanent damage?**
Serious complications are extremely rare with proper technique and client selection. We conduct thorough medical histories and skin assessments to identify contraindications. Following pre- and post-care instructions significantly reduces any risk of adverse effects.

**What should I do if I'm unhappy with my results?**
Contact us immediately if you have concerns. We offer complimentary follow-up appointments to assess results and address issues. For injectables, we can make adjustments at your 2-week follow-up. Most concerns can be resolved through additional treatment or product adjustment.

## PREPARATION & AFTERCARE

**How should I prepare for my treatment?**
General guidelines include: arrive with clean skin (no makeup for facial treatments), avoid blood thinners (aspirin, ibuprofen) for 48 hours before injectables, avoid sun exposure for 2 weeks before laser treatments, stay hydrated, and inform us of any medication changes. Specific instructions are provided when booking.

**What should I avoid before treatment?**
Avoid alcohol (24-48 hours before), blood-thinning medications and supplements unless prescribed by a doctor, retinoids (2-5 days before certain treatments), waxing or aggressive exfoliation (1 week before), and sun exposure or tanning (2 weeks before laser treatments).

**Can I exercise after treatment?**
This depends on the treatment. Light walking is generally fine, but avoid strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours after most treatments. Sweating can irritate treated skin and increase bruising risk. We provide specific exercise guidelines for each procedure.

**When can I resume my skincare routine?**
After most facials, resume your routine the next day. After chemical peels or laser treatments, wait 48-72 hours before using active ingredients like retinoids or acids. Use only gentle, recommended products during healing. We'll provide a specific timeline based on your treatment.

**What products should I use after treatment?**
We provide customized aftercare products with your treatment. Generally, use gentle cleansers, hydrating serums, barrier repair creams, and broad-spectrum SPF 30+. Avoid harsh actives, fragranced products, and exfoliants during the healing period.

**How important is sun protection after treatment?**
Extremely important. Treated skin is more vulnerable to sun damage, which can cause hyperpigmentation and interfere with results. Wear SPF 30+ daily, reapply every 2 hours if outdoors, wear protective clothing and hats, and avoid direct sun exposure for 2 weeks post-treatment.

**What if I develop complications?**
Contact us immediately if you experience severe pain, unusual swelling, signs of infection (increasing redness, warmth, pus), allergic reactions, or any concerning symptoms. We provide 24/7 emergency contact information and will see you promptly to address any issues.

**When can I have another treatment?**
This varies by procedure. Botox can be repeated every 3-4 months. Facials can be monthly. Chemical peels typically need 4-6 weeks between sessions. Laser treatments are spaced 4-8 weeks apart. We'll provide a customized treatment schedule to optimize your results safely.
